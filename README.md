# bus_timetable_app-2.0
a full stack website (using Java EE, on Eclipse) displaying the times when my buses are coming

-strengths
gives me all the relevant info at the click of a button
easy to use
instant



-limitations
adding bus info not really scalable as of yet
will work on frontend more
eclipse doesn't support animations or variables for css

the data may be out of date
